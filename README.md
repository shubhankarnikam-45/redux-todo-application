# 🧠 Redux Todo + Theme App

This is a simple React + Redux application that demonstrates how to build and manage **multiple reducers** using `combineReducers()` in a clean and maintainable way.

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ Add and remove todos dynamically
- 🌗 Toggle between Light and Dark theme
- 🔄 Uses two separate reducers:
  - `todoReducer` – Manages the list of todos
  - `themeReducer` – Manages the dark/light mode
- 🧩 Combined using `combineReducers()` to form the root reducer
- 📁 Standard Redux project structure with:
  - `actionTypes` for type safety
  - `actions` for dispatch logic
  - `reducers` to update state
- 🔍 State changes visible through Redux DevTools
